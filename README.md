This is a sample project that I completed for one of my courses through UC Berkeley's Extension program.  Using the Healthcare.csv datafile that exists in this repository, I go through a series of steps to explore the data and then run various linear models on the data, using root mean squared as evaluation criteria to identify the model that yields the best performance.
